# 🚀 Naukri Auto Apply Bot

A Playwright + JavaScript automation bot that automatically searches and applies to relevant jobs on Naukri based on configurable criteria such as:

- Keywords
- Location
- Experience
- Easy Apply jobs

The bot also generates Excel reports for all matched jobs and tracks application status.

---

# 🎯 Why I Built This

Applying to jobs manually on job portals can be repetitive and time-consuming.

This project automates the job search and application process by:

✅ Searching jobs automatically

✅ Filtering jobs based on experience

✅ Applying to Easy Apply jobs

✅ Tracking Manual Apply jobs

✅ Generating Excel reports

The idea was to build a real-world automation project using Playwright and JavaScript while solving a practical problem.
